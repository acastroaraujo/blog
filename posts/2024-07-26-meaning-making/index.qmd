Most sociologists seem to believe that [meaning-making]{.allcaps} is at the center of [cultural sociology]{.allcaps} [@spillman2020].

The problem is that I have never encountered a coherent definition of what [meaning-making]{.allcaps} is supposed be. It is a mostly empty signifier that stands in for all sorts of overlapping concepts—e.g., narrative, habitus, classification, repertoire, norm, script, preference, skill, belief, value, prototype, perception, representation, etc.

Somehow [meaning-making]{.allcaps} is *more* ambiguous than the concept of [culture]{.allcaps}. It cannot be the center of gravity for an entire subfield. So we should get rid of it.

In the meantime this how I make sense of [meaning-making]{.allcaps}.

1.  Anything that can be described as an *expressive* activity produced within some authoritative "cultural" domain, such as art, music, film, literature, dance, and so on.

    This is not what most most cultural sociologists have in mind when they think of [meaning-making]{.allcaps}. But it is what the "production of culture" perspective is all about [@peterson2004].

2.  *Information-processing.* We *hear* some spoken message, we *smell* something. We react quickly, perhaps unconsciously, on the basis of some habitual way of seeing things that is grounded in personal experience. Following @goldberg, this means that we [interpret]{.allcaps} a stimulus through [categorization]{.allcaps} and [association]{.allcaps}.

    Is that *thing* a bird? Is it a plane? That's [categorization]{.allcaps} [@rosch1975].

    Then we have [semantic association]{.allcaps}. That bird can turn out to be food, scary, dirty, sacred, and so on.

3.  *Purpose.*

    Here, "meaning" is something most people try to *find* as they go around "making sense" of their lives.

    Sociologists usually take one of two common approaches. First, the meaning-as-motive approach seeks to understand action in terms of goals and values. Second, the meaning-as-justification approach which focuses on understanding the *reasons* people give to why-questions. The former finds the "true springs of action" in motivational concepts (e.g., desires, interests, values), whereas the latter sees "meaning" as something that works retroactively (e.g., narratives, accounts).[^1]

    So we have two different ways of thinking about "purpose" that *not always* overlap: [cause]{.allcaps} and [reason]{.allcaps}.

[^1]: See @mills1940, @scott1968, @swidler1986, @vaisey2009, @small2021, and so on. Fortunately, the idea that "motives" and "talk of motives" are somehow at odds with each other is no longer prevalent.

*Note. If you combine information-processing and meaning-as-motive you end up with a modern rendition of Max Weber's [-@weber1978] interpretative sociology. This should be the actual "center of gravity" for cultural sociologists.*
