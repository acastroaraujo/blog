It happened sometime during the last few years. I lost all patience for [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). I react viscerally when I see other people injecting ambiguity and uncertainty in their writing. And I feel some sort of catholic guilt when I catch myself doing it.

This *feeling* is not rooted in a preference for clear thinking, nor is it a disdain for ambiguity or lazy thinking. No, it has more to do with integrity. I am thinking about the kinds of words that create distance between yourself and what you say. These words remove accountability. *Cowards use them all the time.*

> *And what may weasel words be? Why weasel words are words that suck all the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks an egg and leaves the shell.*

For example, sociologists will use weasel words to insinuate causal claims without having to commit to them---e.g., 'affect', 'influence', 'shape', and so on. They will describe someone or some policy as being 'complicit with' or 'enabling' something bad instead of describing them outright as *doing* something bad.

This feeling is not widespread. We are also told that injecting uncertainty or ambiguity into our writing is a mark of caution and humility, not cowardice. [Hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(linguistics)) are a marker of *polite speech*. And American sociologists value politeness above all else *("We are not rude like the economists!").*

Injecting uncertainty and ambiguity in the things you say creates the image of humility and politeness. But it also insulates you from being wrong. *("A feature, not a bug").* You will never be wrong unless you make a commitment.

Do not be a coward.

Say what you mean. Bear witness. Iterate.
