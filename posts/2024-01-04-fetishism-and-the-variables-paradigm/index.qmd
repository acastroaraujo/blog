Karl Marx's criticism of commodity fetishism is very similar to Andrew Abbott's criticism of the so-called "variables paradigm" (i.e., most quantitative research).

Before getting into detail, let me note the following:

-   This kind of criticism exhibits an "unmasking style" which I find to be deeply childish [cf. @baehr2019]. The idea is that you get to be some kind of deep critical thinker that somehow has gained a unique access to a "reality" that is hidden from less sophisticated individuals.

-   It gives off the same vibes as Plato's Cave; Marxist false consciousness; and that one famous red pill scene from The Matrix.

-   The critic is in a unique position to expose widespread delusions and show that what "normal" people believe to be true is in reality false.

-   In order to engage in such criticism, the best strategy is to write in such a way that makes other people look foolish.[^1]

[^1]: "Connoisseurship gets its aesthetic bite from the easy insinuation that the person trying to simplify things is a bit less sophisticated a thinker than the person pointing out that things are more complicated" [@healy2017, pp. 123].

## Commodity Fetishism

> A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.

The commodity fetishism argument is an invitation to look beyond the surface of appearances, an illusion that ensures that "the definite social relation between men" in a market society "the fantastic form of a relation between things."

The accusation is that normal people see value as an *intrinsic* property of commodities and fail to see it for what it is: *a relational* property*.*

> There are two ways of ascribing properties to objects. Both have the same surface grammatical form: $A$ is $F$. The book is red, the man is tall, the woman is rich. They differ, however, at a deeper level. The height of a person is a quality that inheres in him quite independently of social context. Wealth, on the other hand, can only be predicated of a person who is inserted in a web of social relations. It makes sense to say that Robinson Crusoe on his island was tall, not that he was rich, even if perhaps he brought some gold coins along with him. To be rich means that other people are willing to exchange their goods or labor for your money. Being rich, unlike being tall, is a relational predicate.

> Commodity fetishism is the belief that goods possess value just as they have weight, as an inherent property. To the unmystified mind, it is clear that a commodity has exchange value only because it stands in certain relations io human labor and human needs. In the bewitched world of commodity fetishism, however, goods appear to exchange at a certain rate because of their inherent values. Such, at any rate, was Marx's argument. *It is somewhat unconvincing, because it is hard to believe that anyone ever committed this particular fallacy.*

## The "Variables Paradigm"

Some time ago Andrew Abbott [-@abbott2001] mounted an attack on traditional quantitative researchers by accusing them of foolishly believing that "variables do things, not social actors." In other words, he accused them of being unsophisticated and carrying around a weird metaphysics.

Here are the charges:

-   Quantitative researchers simplify too much.

-   They forget the importance of narrative.

-   They ignore that social activity is located space and time, unlike the always sophisticated Chicago School [cf. @abbott1997].

-   *They are* *plain silly*.

    They don't see individuals as *motivated* *actors*, but merely as the locale for the variables "doing their thing" [@abbott2001, pp. 132]. For example, they actually believe that some disembodied abstraction called [education]{.allcaps} acts on another disembodied abstraction called [occupation]{.allcaps}.

    > Our normal methods parse social reality into fixed entities with variable qualities. They attribute causality to the variables---hypostatized social characteristics---rather than to agents; variables do things, not social actors.
    >
    > @abbott2001 [pp. 183]

The problem with this discussion is that the "variables paradigm" being criticized does not exist. It has never existed. *No one is that dumb.* It's all a bunch of self-congratulatory nonsense.

In a particularly egregious example of bad faith, Andrew Abbott reads a couple of articles from the *American Journal of Sociology* and finds that "narrative sentences usually have variables as subjects" [@abbott2001, pp. 140].[^2] Now imagine overhearing a conversation in which someone mentions the sunset and then rushing to call them a fool for believing the sun revolves around the earth. It is deeply obnoxious.

[^2]: "My procedure is simple. I find all the narrative sentences, the sentences whose predicates are activities or parts of the social process. I then consider who are the subjects of these sentences, what kinds of activities are involved, and how the predicates are related to causality" [@abbott2001, pp. 130].

## Data and Phenomena

As mentioned in a previous [blogpost](https://acastroaraujo.github.io/blog/posts/2023-12-31-data/), I find it useful to distinguish between data and phenomena:

-   **Phenomena**: recurrent features of the world.

-   **Data**: "public records produced by measurement and experiment that serve as evidence for the existence or features of phenomena" [@woodward2011, pp. 166]

The criticism of the so-called "variables paradigm" may be valid in circumstances in which forget this distinction; or in cases in which people conflate data mining with models about phenomena. *But who the fuck actually goes around the world thinking that measurements cause other measurements in some weird kind of social vacuum?*
