When we think about \"data\" we generally think about *standardized* data---i.e., symbols that are arranged in a way that's convenient for computer processing. We think about symbols that are stable and transportable, or what Bruno @latour1987 calls \"immutable and combinable mobiles.\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nN <- 5e3\nsymbols <- c(0:9, letters, \"$\", \"+\", \"!\", \"-\", \"#\", \"Ω\", \"∆\", \"∑\", \"π\")\n\ntibble(\n  x = runif(N),\n  y = runif(N),\n  sym = sample(symbols, size = N, replace = TRUE),\n) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x, y, shape = sym)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 3/4, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_shape_identity() +\n  theme_void(base_family = \"Optima\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
